We can now make our own (very basic) APIs! We are getting close to being able to actually call ourselves full-stack developers! 
Let's make a simple API that covers the basic GET, DELETE, PATCH and POST requests.

 

Setup a GitHub repository and local git repository to track work being done.
Create a python script that achieves the following:
Creates an API with the following 1 endpoint "animals" that supports the following HTTP request types:
GET
Will return a list of animals (random ones made up) in JSON data
POST
Will add an animal to the list of animals and return a success message in text data
This can just be a "hard coded" animal (like a snake every time)
PATCH
Will edit an existing animal in the list of animals and return  a success message in text data
This can just be a "hard coded" animal (like an owl turning into a snowy owl every time)
DELETE
Will delete an animal from the list and return a success message in text data
This can just be a "hard coded" animal (like a mouse every time)
These endpoints do not need to take data from the client!
Add, commit and push your code.
 

BONUS:

Allow users to send data to the server for the POST request
Your server will need to read the animal sent by the user in JSON form and add this specific animal
to the list (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39008071/send-post-data-via-raw-json-with-postman Links to an external site.)
Use a DB instead of a hardcoded list of animals. 
Create a DB and store some animals in the DB. Collect these animals for the GET request, 
add an animal on the POST request, edit the animal on a PATCH request and delete an animal on a DELETE request.
